# 00 â Setup

Three steps, no compiler: probe your machine, fetch the llama.cpp binaries, download
the model.

```bash
make setup                              # default model (Gemma 4 E2B, ~5.2 GB)
LAB_MODEL=qwen35-0.8b make setup        # small model (Qwen3.5 0.8B, ~0.9 GB)
```

Two models are available; pick one and use it for the whole lab. `make probe` recommends
one based on your RAM, and `models/active.json` remembers the choice so later steps do not
need the variable. See [GUIDE.md](../../GUIDE.md) BÆ°á»c 0.2 for the comparison table.

Windows:

```powershell
pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File labs/00-setup/bootstrap.ps1
```

## What each step does

| Script | Output | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `detect-hardware.py` | `hardware.json` | Stdlib only â runs before any install. Every other track reads this for thread count and GPU offload defaults. |
| `fetch-runtime.py` | `runtime/b10488/â¦` | Asks the llama.cpp release API which assets exist, picks the right one for your OS + accelerator, extracts it. 10â35 MB (more for CUDA). |
| `download-model.py` | `models/*.gguf` + `models/active.json` | Two quantizations of the chosen model: [Gemma 4 E2B](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/gemma-4-E2B-it-GGUF) ~5.2 GB, or [Qwen3.5 0.8B](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.5-0.8B-GGUF) ~0.9 GB. Both Apache-2.0 and ungated. Prints the direct URLs, and the exact `curl` commands if the download fails. |

Only `hardware.json` and `models/active.json` get committed. The weights and binaries
are gitignored, and `make verify` never asks for them.

## Outputs you commit

- **`hardware.json`** â rubric item 1
- **`models/active.json`** â rubric item 2

## Overrides

```bash
.venv/bin/python labs/00-setup/fetch-runtime.py --list                 # all release assets
.venv/bin/python labs/00-setup/fetch-runtime.py --asset <name> --force # pick one by hand
.venv/bin/python labs/00-setup/download-model.py --with-mtp            # + MTP head (bonus C1)
.venv/bin/python labs/00-setup/download-model.py --skip-download       # manifest only
```

Runtime knobs live in `.env.example` (`LAB_N_THREADS`, `LAB_N_CTX`, `LAB_PARALLEL`, â¦).
Copy it to `.env` only if you want to override the auto-detected values â the scripts
read the environment directly, so `LAB_N_THREADS=6 make bench` works too.

## If something fails

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `unknown model architecture: 'gemma4'` | Your llama.cpp is too old. `make runtime` re-fetches the pinned build. This is why the lab does not use `llama-cpp-python`. |
| Hugging Face unreachable | [`MANUAL-DOWNLOAD.md`](MANUAL-DOWNLOAD.md) â browser download, then `--skip-download`. |
| GitHub API rate-limited | Harmless: the script falls back to a built-in asset name table. |
| `No prebuilt asset matches â¦` | Run with `--list`, pick manually with `--asset`, or build from source (`make build-llama`). |
| Under 8 GB RAM | `LAB_MODEL=qwen35-0.8b make setup` â runs locally on 4 GB. |
| Under 4 GB RAM | [`cloud/`](../../cloud/README.md) â Colab or Kaggle, same artifacts, same grade. |
